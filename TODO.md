## TODO
- [ ] Let Travis build libvips with pre-compiled dependencies.
  - [ ] Wait for: https://github.com/mxe/mxe/issues/2021.
- [ ] Incorporate all new dependencies and patches into [MXE](https://github.com/mxe/mxe).
  - [ ] Should we also add libvips-web?
  - [ ] Not sure about `librsvg`, because v2.42.0+ requires the Rust toolchain.
- [ ] Try to test the binaries with the Python test suite on Wine.
